# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
Within the file lib/most_coveted_canines/cli.rb, I defined a class called MostCovetedCanines::CLI. I encapsulate the logic for my program into one object of my CLI class, running MostCovetedCanines::CLI.new.call to start my program. (I instantiate an instance of my CLI class and call the #call instance method on that CLI instance). Subsequently, the user follows a series of on screen prompts to interact with my program. My CLI class collaborates with my Dog class and my Scraper class, as methods called on my Dog class within my CLI instance methods depend on class methods called on my Scraper class.

- [x] Pull data from an external source
My project is based on data scraped from the American Kennel Club (AKC) website. The main webpage that contains the AKC's full ranking list of dog breeds is found at the following web address: http://www.akc.org/content/news/articles/most-popular-dog-breeds-full-ranking-list/?button
I delegated the responsibility of scraping the AKC website to my MostCovetedCanines::Scraper class. Within the method body of #scrape_ranking_list called on my Scraper class, I scrape the webpage found at the URL indicated above using Nokogiri. The return value of #scrape_ranking_list is an array that contains 50 hash elements corresponding to 50 dog instances. The keys in each hash represent a single dog instance's @breed and @url properties, and each key points to its respective value scraped from the principal AKC web page. I later instantiate each dog instance with a hash containing its corresponding breed and url key/value pairs, and I use mass assignment within the method body of #initialize to set the dog instance's @breed and @url properties upon instantiation. I also defined a class method on my Scraper class called #scrape_puppy_profile(puppy_url) to extract data from an individual dog's profile page. The method argument, puppy_url, represents an individual dog's profile url, such as http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/. The return value of #scrape_puppy_profile(puppy_url) is a hash containing key/value pairs with data for the additional attributes I will assign a dog instance. The hash keys represent a dog instance's @group, @personality, @year_recognized, @rank, @grooming, @exercise, @fun_fact and @appearance attributes. The values corresponding to these key attributes were scraped, using Nokogiri, from a dog's profile page.

- [x] Implement both list and detail views
The #unleash_dogs CLI instance method is the last procedure executed within the method body of #call, which, in turn, is called on an instance of my CLI class to run my entire program. The method #unleash dogs first allows a user to select one of five ranking tiers listed, which are each composed of 10 dog breeds. If a valid range is selected, #reveal_range(range_starts_at) is called to list the ten dogs in that ranking tier by rank and breed. Since each dog instance was instantiated with an @breed attribute, retrieved by scraping data from the main AKC full ranking list webpage, I listed the dog breeds by calling the #breed instance getter method on each dog instance to access each dog instance's @breed attribute value. Subsequently, #demand_dog(range_starts_at) drills down one level deeper by allowing a user to enter a specific rank number to learn more about an individual dog breed. If the user's input is valid, #showcase_dog(input) is called to display detailed, comprehensive information about a particular dog instances's attributes, based on data scraped from an individual dog's profile page.
